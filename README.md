# Bugfixed and improved Half-Life
Bugfixed and Improved Half-Life Release (BugfixedHL for short) is a Half-Life modification that
aims to improve DM experience for players and fix server bugs for server owners while being
completely backwards-compatible with vanilla clients and servers.

Source code is based on HLSDK 2.3-p3 patched by Metamod team. Later partially updated to [ValveSoftware/halflife](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/halflife)
for Linux support. Uses VGUI2 code from [SamVanheer/HLEnhanced.](https://github.com/SamVanheer/HLEnhanced)
